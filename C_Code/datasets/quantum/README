Preprocessing:
1) Remove column 1 (EXAMPLE_ID).
2) Remove columns 22, 23, 24 and 46, 47, 48, and 31, 57 because those features may contain missing values.
3) Remove columns 49, 50, 51, 52, 53 because they are constant.
4) Treat column 2 as labels. Convert them from {0, 1} to {-1, 1}.
5) Scale all the features to [-1, 1].
Columns are enumerated from 1.

Samples: 50,000.
Features: 65.
